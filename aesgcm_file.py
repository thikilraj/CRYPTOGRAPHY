"""
This is a simple example of using the cryptography module to securely encrypt and decrypt data to and from files using
AES in GCM mode.

GCM (Galois Counter Mode) is a mode of operation for block ciphers. An AEAD (authenticated
encryption with additional data) mode is a type of block cipher mode that simultaneously encrypts
the message as well as authenticating it. Additional unencrypted data may also be authenticated.
Additional means of verifying integrity such as HMAC are not necessary.

NOTE: There is a better way to do AES-GCM in Cryptography version 2.0 or newer using the AES-GCM construction which is
composed of the AES block cipher utilizing GCM mode.  This should be compatible with Cryptography 1.7 or newer.

This is intended to be used in conjunction with teh "aesgcm_file.c" example code for demonstrating interoperability
between Python's Cryptography module and the mbed TLS C library for AES-256 in GCM mode.
