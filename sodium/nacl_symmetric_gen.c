/* Generates a random 256-bit (32-byte) secret symmetric key using libsodium
 *
 * This key is intended tobe used with libsodium "secretbox" secret-key authenticated encryption routines.
 *
 * These routines use the XSalsa20 stream cipher for encryption and the Poly1305 MAC for authentication
 * in pre-packaged set of routines for doing authenticated encryption using symmetric keys.
 *
 * NOTE: This is NOT an AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data) mode because the MAC computation
 * is done over the encrypted ciphertext and does not include any additional data.
 *
 * XSalsa20 is a stream cipher based upon Salsa20 but with a much longer nonce: 192 bits instead of 64 bits.
 *
 * XSalsa20 uses a 256-bit key as well as the first 128 bits of the nonce in order to compute a subkey. This subkey, as
 * well as the remaining 64 bits of the nonce, are the parameters of the Salsa20 function used to actually generate the
 * stream.
 *
 * Like Salsa20, XSalsa20 is immune to timing attacks and provides its own 64-bit block counter to avoid incrementing
 * the nonce after each block. But with XSalsa20's longer nonce, it is safe to generate nonces using randombytes_buf()
 * for every message encrypted with the same key without having to worry about a collision.
